<h3> Mayonnaise Algorithm </h3>
The Mayonnaise Algorithm is based on the spaced repetition algorithm called <b>Leitner System</b> but is modified to fit the gamification element. Mayonnaise Algorithm sorts out the items in such a way that the first items will be your most forgetful ones while the last will be the ones that you have no trouble remembering, as such this helps you focus that much on the difficult terminologies without the easier ones being a hurdle.
